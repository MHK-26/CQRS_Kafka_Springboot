## Overview:
The Java CQRS and Event Sourcing with Kafka for Banking Operations project is a robust and scalable system designed to handle core banking operations while leveraging advanced architectural patterns such as CQRS and event sourcing. This project emphasizes building a secure, event-driven system capable of processing financial transactions efficiently.

## Key Features:
- Account Management:
Open and close accounts securely.
Unique customer identifiers for personalized banking experiences.

- Fund Operations:
Deposit funds into customer accounts.
Withdraw funds with real-time updates.

- CQRS Implementation:
Utilize the Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern for better scalability and maintainability.
Separate read and write operations to optimize system performance.

- Event Sourcing:
Capture and store all changes to application state as a sequence of events.
Enable auditing, traceability, and historical analysis of transactions.

- Integration with Kafka:
Leverage Kafka for building a reliable and fault-tolerant event-driven architecture.
Enable seamless communication between microservices and event producers/consumers.

- Dockerized Spring Boot Application:
Containerize the application components for easy deployment and scalability.
Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- Restoring Read Database:
Implement a feature to restore the read database from event logs.
Allow for efficient recovery of the read-side database in case of failures or data corruption.

## Tech Stack:
- Java: Core programming language for building the application logic.
- Spring Boot: Framework for creating robust and scalable microservices.
- CQRS Pattern: Optimize read and write operations independently.
- Event Sourcing: Capture and persist state-changing events.
- Kafka: Distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
- Docker: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments.
