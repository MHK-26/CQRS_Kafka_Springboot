##Overview:
The Java CQRS and Event Sourcing with Kafka for Banking Operations project is a robust and scalable system designed to handle core banking operations while leveraging advanced architectural patterns such as CQRS and event sourcing. This project emphasizes building a secure, event-driven system capable of processing financial transactions efficiently.

##Key Features:
Account Management:

Open and close accounts securely.
Unique customer identifiers for personalized banking experiences.
Fund Operations:

Deposit funds into customer accounts.
Withdraw funds with real-time updates.
CQRS Implementation:

Utilize the Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern for better scalability and maintainability.
Separate read and write operations to optimize system performance.
Event Sourcing:

Capture and store all changes to application state as a sequence of events.
Enable auditing, traceability, and historical analysis of transactions.
Integration with Kafka:

Leverage Kafka for building a reliable and fault-tolerant event-driven architecture.
Enable seamless communication between microservices and event producers/consumers.
Dockerized Spring Boot Application:

Containerize the application components for easy deployment and scalability.
Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
Restoring Read Database:

Implement a feature to restore the read database from event logs.
Allow for efficient recovery of the read-side database in case of failures or data corruption.
